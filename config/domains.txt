# Add your domains here. Each new line provisions a new certificate file
# If you add the domains in a single line, 
# then they will all appear on a single certificate.
# The first domain in a single line will be in the CN (Common Name) field
# Other domains in a single line will be in SAN field (Subject Alternative Name)
# Using SANs for all needed domains you can create a single cert that
# works for multiple domains, essentialy having something similar to a wildcard cert.
